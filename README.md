# Experiments on NDPX Kernels
To analyze NDPX kernels, I made this repository.

## Prerequistics
You need NDPX simulator and slurm to use this.

## Basic Usage
 - Use `python make_ndpx_sim_dir.py` to generate simulation directories for each NDPX kernels.
 - Use `sh make_ndpx_sim_env.sh` to genearte simulation environment directory.
 - Use `sh get_ndpx_sim_result.sh` to run simulation.
